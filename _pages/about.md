# About me
I am a Data Scientist in the Translational Research Team of Resilience, and affiliated research in the Jacob Wolzfwitz Visiting Assistant Professor at Cornell University.

I hold a PhD in Statistics from CREST and Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My supervisor was Nicolas Chopin. My manuscript is available here and you can find the slides from the defense here.

My research delves into the foundational aspects of mathematical statistics and machine learning, placing a special emphasis on crafting practical and efficient learning methods with provable theoretical guarantees. I am particularly interested in time series, random matrix theory and high dimensional estimation problems.
