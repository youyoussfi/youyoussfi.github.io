I am a Data Scientist in the Translational Research Team of Resilience Care, and affiliated researcher at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (CREST, ENSAE).

I hold a PhD in Statistics from CREST and Institut Polytechnique de Paris, supervised by Nicolas Chopin and Pr. Xavier Jouven. 

My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for analyzing large-scale healthcare data. I am particularly interested in time series analysis of electronic health records,real-world evidence in epidemiology and Bayesian methods.
