I am a Data Scientist in the *Translational Research Team* of [Resilience Care](https://www.resilience.care) </a>, and an affiliated researcher in statistics at the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics](https://crest.science/) (CREST, ENSAE).

I hold a PhD in Statistics from CREST and [Polytechnique Institute of Paris] (https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), supervised by [Nicolas Chopin](https://nchopin.github.io/) and [Pr. Xavier Jouven](https://parcc.inserm.fr/index.php/04-cv-xavier-jouven/).

My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for analyzing large-scale healthcare data. I am particularly interested in time series analysis of electronic health records, real-world evidence in epidemiology Bayesian methods and causal analysis.
