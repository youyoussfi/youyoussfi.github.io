Welcome to my page ! I am a Data Scientist in the *Translational Research Team* of [Resilience Care](https://www.resilience.care), a digital solution dedicated to remote monitoring and personalized support for oncology patients, and an affiliated researcher in statistics at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/), [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en)).

I hold a PhD in Statistics from CREST and [Polytechnique Institute of Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), supervised by [Nicolas Chopin](https://nchopin.github.io/) and [Pr. Xavier Jouven](https://parcc.inserm.fr/index.php/04-cv-xavier-jouven/).

My research focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing large-scale healthcare data. I am particularly interested in time series analysis of electronic health records, real-world evidence in epidemiology, Bayesian methods and causal inference analysis.
